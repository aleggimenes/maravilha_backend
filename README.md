Getting Started with Sequelize

This project utilizes Sequelize, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, to interact with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm start

Runs the application in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when changes are made to the source code.
npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

See the documentation for running tests for more information.
npm run build

Builds the application for production to the build folder.

It correctly configures Sequelize for production mode and optimizes the build for performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for caching.

Your application is ready to be deployed!

See the documentation for deployment for more information.
npm run migrate

Runs Sequelize migrations to manage database schema changes.

This command applies pending migrations to the database, ensuring that the database structure is up-to-date with the application's codebase.
Learn More

You can learn more about Sequelize in the official documentation.

To learn more about Node.js, check out the Node.js documentation.
Database Configuration

Configure your database connection in the config/config.json file. Sequelize supports multiple database dialects such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and others.
Models and Migrations

Define your database models using Sequelize's model definitions. Organize your database schema changes using migrations.

See the documentation for models and migrations for more information.
Advanced Configuration

Customize Sequelize's behavior by configuring advanced options such as logging, connection pooling, and more.

See the advanced configuration documentation for more details.
Deployment

Before deploying your application to production, make sure to properly configure your database connection and run migrations to ensure that your database schema is up-to-date.

See the documentation for deployment for more information.
